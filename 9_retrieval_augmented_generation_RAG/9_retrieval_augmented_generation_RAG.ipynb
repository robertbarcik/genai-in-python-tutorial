    "\n",
    "- **Customer Support**: Answer questions using product documentation\n",
    "- **Internal Knowledge Bases**: Help employees find company information\n",
    "- **Document Q&A**: Extract insights from reports, contracts, or research papers\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🚫 The Problem: LLM Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into RAG, let's understand WHY we need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Knowledge Cutoff Dates\n",
    "LLMs are trained on data up to a specific date. They don't know about:\n",
    "- Recent events or news\n",
    "- New products or companies launched after training\n",
    "- Updated policies or procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "### No Access to Private Data\n",
    "LLMs can't access:\n",
    "- Your company's internal documents\n",
    "- Proprietary customer information\n",
    "- Personal or confidential data\n",
    "- Real-time database contents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hallucination Risks\n",
    "When uncertain, LLMs may:\n",
    "- Generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information\n",
    "- Mix facts from different sources incorrectly\n",
    "- Fill gaps with \"reasonable\" guesses\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ The Solution: RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG gives LLMs the ability to \"look things up\" before answering. Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Three Steps of RAG:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **🔍 Retrieval**\n",
    "   - Search your knowledge base for relevant documents\n",
    "   - Find the information that best matches the user's question\n",
    "   - Like finding the right page in a textbook\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **📝 Augmentation**\n",
    "   - Add the retrieved information to the prompt as \"context\"\n",
    "   - Tell the LLM: \"Here's the relevant information, use it to answer\"\n",
    "   - Like giving someone notes before asking them a question\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **💬 Generation**\n",
    "   - LLM generates an answer based on the provided context\n",
    "   - Answer is grounded in real information, not guesses\n",
    "   - Like a student answering from their notes instead of memory\n",

    "- Measures the angle between two vectors\n",
    "- Returns a value between -1 and 1\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine two arrows in space:\n",
    "- If they point in the same direction → high similarity\n",
    "- If they point in different directions → low similarity\n",

    "2. **Embed the question**: Convert it to a vector using the same embedding model\n",

    "   Doc 3 (Ramp):    [0.1, 0.2, 0.8, ...] → similarity: 0.45\n",
    "   ...\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Rank by score**: Sort documents by similarity (highest first)\n",

    "\n",
    "## 📦 Vector Databases in Production\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we stored embeddings in a Pandas DataFrame. This works great for learning with 10 documents, but NOT for production:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Problems with Our Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Slow**: Must compare query to ALL documents every time\n",
    "   - 10 documents: Fast\n",
    "   - 1 million documents: Extremely slow\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Limited Scale**: Can't handle millions of documents\n",
    "   - Everything stored in memory\n",
    "   - No optimization for large-scale search\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No Persistence**: Data lost when notebook closes\n",
    "   - Must regenerate embeddings every time\n",
    "   - No way to update documents incrementally\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Advanced Features**:\n",
    "   - Can't filter by metadata (\"cybersecurity companies only\")\n",
    "   - No hybrid search (semantic + keyword)\n",
    "   - No approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Production Solution: Vector Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector databases are specialized systems optimized for similarity search:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Popular Vector Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pinecone**: Fully managed, cloud-based, easy to use\n",
    "- **Weaviate**: Open-source, supports hybrid search\n",
    "- **Chroma**: Simple, lightweight, great for prototyping\n",
    "- **Qdrant**: Fast, Rust-based, good for production\n",
    "- **Milvus**: Open-source, scalable, enterprise-ready\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 What Vector Databases Provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fast Search**:\n",
    "   - Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms\n",
    "   - HNSW, IVF, etc.\n",
    "   - Search millions of vectors in milliseconds\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scalability**:\n",
    "   - Handle billions of vectors\n",
    "   - Distributed storage\n",
    "   - Horizontal scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Persistence**:\n",
    "   - Store embeddings permanently\n",
    "   - Add/update/delete documents\n",
    "   - No need to regenerate\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Advanced Features**:\n",
    "   - Metadata filtering\n",
    "   - Hybrid search (semantic + keyword)\n",
    "   - Multi-vector search\n",
    "   - Analytics and monitoring\n",

    "## 🏗️ Other Production Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Document Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Long documents don't fit in context windows\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Break documents into smaller chunks\n",
    "- Chunk size: 200-500 words typical\n",
    "- Overlap: 10-20% to maintain context\n",
    "- Methods: Sentence-based, semantic chunking, fixed-size\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Metadata Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \"Find cybersecurity companies in the USA\"\n",
    "- Pre-filter by country = USA\n",
    "- Then semantic search within filtered set\n",
    "- Faster and more accurate\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Hybrid Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Combine semantic + keyword search:\n",
    "- Semantic: Understands meaning\n",
    "- Keyword: Exact matches (names, IDs, codes)\n",
    "- Best of both worlds!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Re-ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "Two-stage retrieval:\n",
    "1. Fast retrieval: Get top 50 documents (fast, approximate)\n",
    "2. Re-ranking: Use more sophisticated model on top 50\n",
    "3. Return top 5 after re-ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you know if your RAG system is working well?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval Metrics**:\n",
    "- Precision@k: How many retrieved docs are relevant?\n",
    "- Recall@k: Did we retrieve all relevant docs?\n",
    "- MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank): Where do relevant docs appear?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generation Metrics**:\n",
    "- Faithfulness: Is answer grounded in context?\n",
    "- Relevance: Does answer address the question?\n",
    "- Human evaluation: Still the gold standard!\n",
