    "# 🤖 RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this hands-on tutorial on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RAG** is a technique that combines the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ability to retrieve relevant information from external knowledge sources. Think of it as giving the AI access to \"notes\" or a \"textbook\" when answering questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs like GPT are incredibly powerful, but they have limitations:\n",
    "- They only know what they were trained on (knowledge cutoff dates)\n",
    "- They have no access to your private/proprietary data\n",
    "- They can't know about recent events or updates\n",
    "- They may \"hallucinate\" (make up information) when uncertain\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✨ The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG solves these problems by:\n",
    "1. **Retrieving** relevant documents from your knowledge base\n",
    "2. **Augmenting** the prompt with this retrieved information\n",
    "3. **Generating** an accurate answer based on the provided context\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💼 Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Support**: Answer questions using product documentation\n",
    "- **Internal Knowledge Bases**: Help employees find company information\n",
    "- **Document Q&A**: Extract insights from reports, contracts, or research papers\n",
    "- **Code Documentation**: Search through codebases and generate explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎓 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Understand the three components of RAG** (Retrieval → Augmentation → Generation)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Learn about embeddings** and how they represent meaning numerically\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Implement semantic search** to find relevant documents\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Build a complete RAG pipeline** from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Understand production considerations** (vector databases, chunking, etc.)\n",

    "# 1️⃣ Theory: Why RAG Exists\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚫 The Problem: LLM Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into RAG, let's understand WHY we need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Knowledge Cutoff Dates\n",
    "LLMs are trained on data up to a specific date. They don't know about:\n",
    "- Recent events or news\n",
    "- New products or companies launched after training\n",
    "- Updated policies or procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "### No Access to Private Data\n",
    "LLMs can't access:\n",
    "- Your company's internal documents\n",
    "- Proprietary customer information\n",
    "- Personal or confidential data\n",
    "- Real-time database contents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hallucination Risks\n",
    "When uncertain, LLMs may:\n",
    "- Generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information\n",
    "- Mix facts from different sources incorrectly\n",
    "- Fill gaps with \"reasonable\" guesses\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Key Insight**: LLMs can only work with what they \"remember\" from training. They can't look things up!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ The Solution: RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG gives LLMs the ability to \"look things up\" before answering. Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Three Steps of RAG:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **🔍 Retrieval**\n",
    "   - Search your knowledge base for relevant documents\n",
    "   - Find the information that best matches the user's question\n",
    "   - Like finding the right page in a textbook\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **📝 Augmentation**\n",
    "   - Add the retrieved information to the prompt as \"context\"\n",
    "   - Tell the LLM: \"Here's the relevant information, use it to answer\"\n",
    "   - Like giving someone notes before asking them a question\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **💬 Generation**\n",
    "   - LLM generates an answer based on the provided context\n",
    "   - Answer is grounded in real information, not guesses\n",
    "   - Like a student answering from their notes instead of memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Point: Giving LLMs \"Notes\"\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is like giving the LLM access to an open-book test. Instead of relying solely on what it \"remembers\" from training, it can reference your documents to provide accurate, up-to-date answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- LLMs have knowledge cutoffs and can't access private/recent information\n",
    "- RAG enables LLMs to \"look things up\" in your knowledge base\n",
    "- The three steps are: Retrieval → Augmentation → Generation\n",
    "- RAG dramatically reduces hallucinations by grounding answers in real data\n",
    "- RAG makes LLMs practical for domain-specific and private information"

    "## 🔢 What Are Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embeddings** are numerical representations that capture the *meaning* of text. Think of them as coordinates in a \"meaning space.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📍 The Map Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a map where:\n",
    "- Each word or sentence is a point\n",
    "- Similar meanings are close together\n",
    "- Different meanings are far apart\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- \"dog\" and \"puppy\" would be very close\n",
    "- \"dog\" and \"bicycle\" would be far apart\n",
    "- \"king\" - \"man\" + \"woman\" ≈ \"queen\" (famous example!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High-Dimensional**: Typically 1536 dimensions (text-embedding-3-small)\n",
    "2. **Semantic Similarity Preserved**: Similar meanings → similar vectors\n",
    "3. **Mathematically Comparable**: Can calculate distance/similarity between vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings let us:\n",
    "- Search by *meaning*, not just keywords\n",
    "- Find \"cybersecurity startup\" even when the text says \"security company\"\n",
    "- Match \"who invested?\" with text about \"key investors\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 How Semantic Search Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the complete process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embed All Documents** (one-time setup)\n",
    "   - Convert each document to an embedding vector\n",
    "   - Store these vectors (in production: use a vector database)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embed the Query** (at search time)\n",
    "   - Convert user's question to an embedding vector\n",
    "   - Use the same embedding model!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate Similarity**\n",
    "   - Compare query embedding with all document embeddings\n",
    "   - Use cosine similarity or dot product\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Retrieve Top Matches**\n",
    "   - Rank documents by similarity score\n",
    "   - Return the most relevant documents\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Insight: Semantic vs Keyword Search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keyword Search** (traditional):\n",
    "- Finds exact word matches\n",
    "- \"car\" won't match \"automobile\"\n",
    "- Order and context don't matter much\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic Search** (embeddings):\n",

    "### 🧮 Cosine Similarity\n",

    "\n",
    "- Measures the angle between two vectors\n",
    "- Returns a value between -1 and 1\n",
    "- 1 = identical direction (very similar)\n",
    "- 0 = perpendicular (unrelated)\n",
    "- -1 = opposite direction (very different)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Simple Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine two arrows in space:\n",
    "- If they point in the same direction → high similarity\n",
    "- If they point in different directions → low similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this works**: Documents with similar meanings have embeddings that \"point\" in similar directions in the high-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📐 The Formula (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cosine_similarity(A, B) = (A · B) / (||A|| * ||B||)\n",
    "```\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "   Question: [0.2, 0.5, 0.1, ...]\n",

    "### Without RAG (Baseline):\n",
    "```\n",
    "LLM receives: \"What does Pentera do?\"\n",
    "LLM thinks: \"I don't have specific information about this company\"\n",
    "LLM responds: \"I don't have current information...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### With RAG:\n",
    "```\n",
    "LLM receives: \"Here's info about Pentera: [full context]. Now answer: What does Pentera do?\"\n",
    "LLM thinks: \"I can see exactly what Pentera does in the context\"\n",
    "LLM responds: \"Pentera provides automated security validation platforms...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reduces Hallucination**: Model has facts to work with\n",
    "2. **Provides Source Attribution**: We know where the answer came from\n",
    "3. **Up-to-date Information**: Documents can be updated without retraining\n",
    "4. **Domain-Specific**: Works with private/proprietary information\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- RAG prompts provide context explicitly before asking the question\n",
    "- Clear instructions tell the model to use only the provided context\n",
    "- This is the \"Augmentation\" step - enriching the prompt with retrieved info\n",
    "- Augmented prompts dramatically reduce hallucination\n",
    "- The model can now answer accurately about specific, private, or recent information"

    "3. **No Persistence**: Data lost when notebook closes\n",
    "   - Must regenerate embeddings every time\n",
    "   - No way to update documents incrementally\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Advanced Features**:\n",
    "   - Can't filter by metadata (\"cybersecurity companies only\")\n",
    "   - No hybrid search (semantic + keyword)\n",
    "   - No approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms\n",

    "## ✅ Production Solution: Vector Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector databases are specialized systems optimized for similarity search:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Popular Vector Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pinecone**: Fully managed, cloud-based, easy to use\n",
    "- **Weaviate**: Open-source, supports hybrid search\n",
    "- **Chroma**: Simple, lightweight, great for prototyping\n",
    "- **Qdrant**: Fast, Rust-based, good for production\n",
    "- **Milvus**: Open-source, scalable, enterprise-ready\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 What Vector Databases Provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fast Search**: \n",
    "   - Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms\n",
    "   - HNSW, IVF, etc.\n",
    "   - Search millions of vectors in milliseconds\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scalability**: \n",
    "   - Handle billions of vectors\n",
    "   - Distributed storage\n",
    "   - Horizontal scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Persistence**: \n",
    "   - Store embeddings permanently\n",
    "   - Add/update/delete documents\n",
    "   - No need to regenerate\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Advanced Features**:\n",
    "   - Metadata filtering\n",
    "   - Hybrid search (semantic + keyword)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Break documents into smaller chunks\n",
    "- Chunk size: 200-500 words typical\n",
    "- Overlap: 10-20% to maintain context\n",
    "- Methods: Sentence-based, semantic chunking, fixed-size\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Metadata Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \"Find cybersecurity companies in the USA\"\n",
    "- Pre-filter by country = USA\n",
    "- Then semantic search within filtered set\n",
    "- Faster and more accurate\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Hybrid Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Combine semantic + keyword search:\n",
    "- Semantic: Understands meaning\n",
    "- Keyword: Exact matches (names, IDs, codes)\n",
    "- Best of both worlds!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Re-ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "Two-stage retrieval:\n",
    "1. Fast retrieval: Get top 50 documents (fast, approximate)\n",
    "2. Re-ranking: Use more sophisticated model on top 50\n",
    "3. Return top 5 after re-ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you know if your RAG system is working well?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval Metrics**:\n",
    "- Precision@k: How many retrieved docs are relevant?\n",

    "# 1️⃣1️⃣ Best Practices & Common Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Best Practices for RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Document Quality\n",
    "✅ **Do**:\n",
    "- Clean, well-structured documents\n",
    "- Remove irrelevant content (headers, footers, boilerplate)\n",
    "- Consistent formatting\n",
    "- Clear, descriptive text\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't**:\n",
    "- Include lots of HTML tags, formatting codes\n",
    "- Have inconsistent document structures\n",
    "- Mix multiple topics in one document\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Prompt Engineering\n",
    "✅ **Do**:\n",
    "- Give clear instructions (\"Answer using ONLY the context\")\n",
    "- Define behavior for missing information\n",
    "- Use system messages effectively\n",
    "- Note: gpt-5-nano only supports default temperature (1)\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't**:\n",
    "- Use vague instructions\n",
    "- Let model make things up when unsure\n",
    "- Specify unsupported parameters like custom temperature values\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Error Handling\n",
    "✅ **Do**:\n",
    "- Handle API failures gracefully\n",
    "- Check for None/empty results\n",
    "- Validate embedding generation\n",
    "- Log errors for debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't**:\n",
    "- Assume APIs always succeed\n",
    "- Return raw error messages to users\n",
    "- Skip validation checks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Context Boundaries\n",
    "✅ **Do**:\n",
    "- Tell model what to do if context is insufficient\n",
    "- Monitor token usage\n",
    "- Handle context window limits\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't**:\n",
    "- Exceed context limits silently\n",
    "- Force model to answer without enough info\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Validation\n",
    "✅ **Do**:\n",
    "- Check similarity scores (low score = poor match)\n",
    "- Set thresholds (e.g., reject if similarity < 0.7)\n",
    "- Test with various question types\n",
    "- Monitor quality over time\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't**:\n",
    "- Return results with very low similarity scores\n",
    "- Assume all retrievals are good\n",
    "- Skip testing edge cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Cost Awareness\n",
    "✅ **Do**:\n",
    "- Cache embeddings (don't regenerate)\n",
    "- Use appropriate models (text-embedding-3-small)\n",
    "- Monitor API usage\n",
    "- Batch embedding generation when possible\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't**:\n",
    "- Regenerate embeddings unnecessarily\n",
    "- Use expensive models when cheaper ones work\n",
    "- Ignore token costs\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Vague Questions\n",
    "❌ **Bad**: \"What is this about?\"\n",
    "- Too general, hard to find relevant documents\n",
    "- Unclear what information is needed\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Good**: \"What does Pentera do and who are their main investors?\"\n",
    "- Specific, clear information request\n",
    "- Easy to retrieve relevant documents\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Not Handling No Results\n",
    "❌ **Bad**: Assume there's always a good match\n",
    "```python\n",
    "answer = rag_pipeline(query, df)\n",
    "return answer  # What if similarity is 0.2?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Good**: Check similarity and handle low scores\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if result['similarity'] < 0.7:\n",
    "    return \"I don't have relevant information to answer that.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Ignoring Context Limits\n",
    "❌ **Bad**: Stuff 50 documents into context\n",
    "- May exceed token limits\n",
    "- Confuses the model\n",
    "- Expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Good**: Use appropriate top_k (1-5 typically)\n",
    "- Focused, relevant context\n",
    "- Within token limits\n",
    "- Cost-effective\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Poor Document Structure\n",
    "❌ **Bad**: \"Everything in one huge document\"\n",
    "- Hard to retrieve specific information\n",
    "- May exceed context limits\n",
    "- Poor retrieval quality\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Good**: One focused document per topic/entity\n",
    "- Easy to retrieve relevant info\n",
    "- Better semantic search\n",
    "- Fits in context window\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. No Fallback Strategy\n",
    "❌ **Bad**: Crash when API fails\n",
    "```python\n",
    "embedding = get_embedding(text)  # What if this fails?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Good**: Handle failures gracefully\n",
    "```python\n",
    "embedding = get_embedding(text)\n",
    "if embedding is None:\n",
    "    return \"Service temporarily unavailable\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Assuming Perfect Retrieval\n",
    "❌ **Bad**: Trust all retrieved documents blindly\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Good**: \n",
    "- Verify similarity scores\n",
    "- Test with diverse questions\n",
    "- Have humans review outputs\n",
    "- Iterate and improve\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Document quality and structure directly impact retrieval quality\n",
    "- Always validate similarity scores before using retrieved docs\n",
    "- Error handling is crucial for production systems\n",
    "- Clear prompts and instructions reduce hallucination\n",
    "- Monitor costs and optimize model choices\n",
    "- Test thoroughly with diverse questions and edge cases\n",
    "- Remember: gpt-5-nano has model-specific constraints (e.g., default temperature only)"
