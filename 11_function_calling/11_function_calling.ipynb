    "By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand function calling fundamentals** - What it is, why it matters, and when to use it\n",
    "2. **Define tool schemas** - Create structured descriptions that help LLMs understand available functions\n",
    "3. **Master the function calling loop** - Execute the complete request-response-execution-response cycle\n",
    "4. **Handle responses correctly** - Distinguish between text responses and function call requests\n",
    "5. **Build production-ready implementations** - Write reusable, error-handled function calling code\n",

    "## 💼 Business Value: Why Function Calling Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Function calling bridges the gap between conversational AI and real-world actions. Instead of LLMs just generating text, they can now:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Access live data** - Fetch current weather, stock prices, database records\n",
    "- **Perform actions** - Book appointments, send emails, update records\n",
    "- **Query systems** - Search knowledge bases, run database queries, call APIs\n",
    "- **Automate workflows** - Chain multiple operations together intelligently\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌟 Real-World Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Service Chatbots** - Check order status, process refunds, schedule callbacks\n",
    "- **Personal Assistants** - Book meetings, set reminders, check calendars\n",
    "- **Data Analysis Tools** - Query databases, generate reports, visualize data\n",
    "- **Smart Home Control** - Adjust temperature, turn on lights, check security cameras\n",
    "- **E-commerce** - Search products, check inventory, process orders\n",

    "# 📚 1. Theory: What is Function Calling?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function calling** is a capability that allows Large Language Models to intelligently request the execution of external functions. Instead of the LLM trying to generate an answer from its training data alone, it can recognize when it needs external information or actions, and request specific function calls with appropriate parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this: Imagine you're a manager (the LLM) with a team of specialists (functions). When someone asks you a question, you can either answer from your own knowledge, or you can ask a specialist on your team to help. Function calling is how you ask your specialists for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are trained on static data with a knowledge cutoff. They don't have access to:\n",
    "- Real-time information (current weather, stock prices, etc.)\n",
    "- Private data (your database, user records, etc.)\n",
    "- System capabilities (sending emails, updating databases, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Function calling solves this by letting LLMs:\n",
    "1. **Recognize** when external data or actions are needed\n",
    "2. **Request** specific functions with the right parameters\n",
    "3. **Incorporate** the results into their responses\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Function Calling vs. Just Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use regular prompting when:**\n",
    "- The answer can be generated from the LLM's training data\n",
    "- You need creative or analytical responses\n",
    "- No real-time or private data is required\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use function calling when:**\n",
    "- You need real-time data (weather, prices, availability)\n",
    "- You need to query private systems (databases, APIs)\n",
    "- You need to perform actions (book, send, update, delete)\n",
    "- You want structured, reliable data access\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Request-Response Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how function calling works at a high level:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "┌─────────────┐\n",
    "│ User Query  │  \"What's the weather in Paris?\"\n",
    "└──────┬──────┘\n",
    "       │\n",
    "       ▼\n",
    "┌─────────────────┐\n",
    "│   LLM Decides   │  \"I need to call get_current_weather(location='Paris, France')\"\n",
    "└──────┬──────────┘\n",
    "       │\n",
    "       ▼\n",
    "┌─────────────────┐\n",

    "└──────┬──────────┘\n",
    "       │\n",
    "       ▼\n",
    "┌─────────────────┐\n",
    "│    Execute      │  Return: {\"temperature\": 18, \"condition\": \"Cloudy\"}\n",
    "└──────┬──────────┘\n",
    "       │\n",
    "       ▼\n",
    "┌─────────────────┐\n",
    "│  Result Back    │  Send function result back to LLM\n",
    "└──────┬──────────┘\n",
    "       │\n",
    "       ▼\n",
    "┌─────────────────┐\n",
    "│  LLM Response   │  \"The weather in Paris is currently 18°C and cloudy.\"\n",
    "└─────────────────┘\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Key Point: Function Calling vs. Text Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important distinction:**\n",
    "- **Without function calling:** The LLM would try to guess the weather based on general knowledge (\"Paris typically has...\")\n",
    "- **With function calling:** The LLM recognizes it needs current data, requests the function, and uses the actual result\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM doesn't *execute* the function itself - it *requests* that you execute it. You're still in control!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Function calling lets LLMs request execution of external functions instead of just generating text\n",
    "- It bridges LLMs with real-time data, private systems, and actionable capabilities\n",
    "- The LLM decides WHEN to call a function and WHICH parameters to use\n",
    "- You (the developer) execute the actual function and return results to the LLM\n",
    "- This enables building chatbots that can actually DO things, not just talk about them"

    "## Response Types\n",
    "\n",
    "When you make an API call with function calling enabled, the LLM can respond in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regular text response** - The LLM provides a conversational answer (no function needed)\n",
    "2. **Function call request** - The LLM requests to execute one or more functions\n",

    "Understanding which type of response you received is crucial for handling function calling correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Response Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The response object contains:\n",
    "- **`content`** - Text content (if the LLM is providing a conversational response)\n",
    "- **`tool_calls`** - List of function calls (if the LLM wants to call functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to check which one is present to know how to proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Key Point: LLMs Can Ask for Clarification\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's trace through the entire conversation flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Message** (Step 1)\n",
    "   - \"What's the weather in Bratislava right now? Use Celsius.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assistant Message - Function Call Request** (Step 1 response)\n",
    "   - \"I need to call `get_current_weather` with `location='Bratislava, Slovakia'` and `format='celsius'`\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **We Execute the Function** (Steps 2-3)\n",
    "   - Extract function name and parameters\n",
    "   - Call the actual Python function\n",
    "   - Get result: `{\"location\": \"Bratislava\", \"temperature\": 22.5, \"condition\": \"Sunny\"}`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **User Message - Function Result** (Step 4)\n",
    "   - Send the function result back to the LLM as a user message\n",
    "   - Formatted as: \"Function {name} returned: {result}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Assistant Message - Final Response** (Step 5)\n",
    "   - LLM uses the function result to create natural language response\n",
    "   - \"The current weather in Bratislava is 22.5°C and sunny!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conversation continuity:** We maintained one conversation thread throughout\n",
    "- **Proper message roles:** System → User → Assistant (tool call) → Tool (result) → Assistant (answer)\n",
    "- **Tool call tracking:** The `tool_call_id` linked the function result to the original request\n",
    "- **Context preservation:** Each API call had access to the full conversation history\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Key Takeaways: Function Calling Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "- Function calling is a 5-step process: Request → Extract → Execute → Return → Respond\n",
    "- This is ONE continuous conversation, not separate interactions\n",
    "- Always append messages to maintain conversation history\n",
    "- The assistant message (with function call) AND the tool message (with result) both get added\n",
    "- The `tool_call_id` is critical for linking results to requests\n",
    "- The final API call doesn't include `tools` parameter (we don't want more function calls)\n",
    "- The LLM uses the function result to create a natural, conversational response"

    "\n",
    "## What is `tool_choice`?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `tool_choice` parameter gives you control over **whether and how** the LLM uses function calling. It tells the LLM:\n",
    "- Can you call functions?\n",
    "- Should you call functions?\n",
    "- Must you call functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Available Options\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `tool_choice=\"auto\"` (Default)\n",
    "- **Behavior:** LLM decides whether to call a function or respond with text\n",
    "- **When to use:** Most of the time! This gives the LLM freedom to choose the best approach\n",
    "- **Example:** User asks \"What's the weather?\" → LLM calls function. User asks \"Tell me a joke\" → LLM responds with text\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `tool_choice=\"none\"`\n",
    "- **Behavior:** LLM will NOT call any functions, only text responses\n",
    "- **When to use:** When you want to disable function calling temporarily\n",
    "- **Example:** After getting function results, you don't want another function call\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `tool_choice=\"required\"`\n",
    "- **Behavior:** LLM MUST call at least one function (cannot respond with text only)\n",
    "- **When to use:** When you need to force a function call, even if the LLM might normally just answer with text\n",
    "- **Example:** Data extraction tasks where you always need structured output\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. `tool_choice={\"type\": \"function\", \"name\": \"function_name\"}`\n",
    "- **Behavior:** Forces the LLM to call a SPECIFIC function\n",
    "- **When to use:** When you know exactly which function should be called\n",

    "\n",
    "## Why Error Handling Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In production applications, many things can go wrong:\n",
    "- The LLM might request a function that doesn't exist\n",
    "- Function arguments might be invalid or malformed\n",
    "- The function itself might throw an error\n",
    "- The LLM might generate invalid JSON\n",
    "- Network issues might cause API failures\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust error handling ensures your application doesn't crash and provides useful feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Not Checking if `tool_calls` Exists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrong:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ This will crash if no tool calls\n",
    "tool_call = response.output.tool_calls[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "    tool_call = response.output.tool_calls[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Not Handling JSON Parse Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrong:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Will crash if JSON is invalid\n",
    "args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)\n",
    "```\n",

    "    args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)\n",

    "    print(f\"Error parsing arguments: {e}\")\n",
    "    args = {}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Not Validating Function Exists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrong:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Will crash if function doesn't exist\n",
    "result = available_functions[function_name](**args)\n",

    "# 📚 10. Best Practices & Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Best Practices for Function Calling\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Write Clear, Descriptive Function Descriptions**\n",
    "   - The `description` field is critical for the LLM's decision-making\n",
    "   - Be specific about WHEN to use each function\n",
    "   - Distinguish similar functions clearly\n",
    "   - Example: \"Get the current weather\" vs \"Get an N-day weather forecast\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Be Specific About Parameter Types and Constraints**\n",
    "   - Use `enum` to restrict values when possible\n",
    "   - Provide examples in descriptions (\"e.g., San Francisco, CA\")\n",
    "   - Specify format requirements clearly\n",
    "   - Mark required parameters appropriately\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Always Validate Function Exists Before Calling**\n",
    "   - Check if function name is in your available_functions dict\n",
    "   - Return meaningful error messages if not found\n",
    "   - Don't let unknown functions crash your application\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**\n",
    "   - Wrap JSON parsing in try/except\n",
    "   - Catch function execution errors\n",
    "   - Return errors to the LLM in the tool message\n",
    "   - Let the LLM explain errors to users naturally\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Keep Functions Focused and Simple**\n",
    "   - Each function should do ONE thing well\n",
    "   - Avoid complex multi-purpose functions\n",
    "   - Make functions easy to test independently\n",
    "   - Keep parameter lists manageable (3-5 parameters max)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Use tool_choice Strategically**\n",
    "   - Default to \"auto\" for natural behavior\n",
    "   - Use \"required\" for structured data extraction\n",
    "   - Use \"none\" when you don't want function calls\n",
    "   - Force specific functions only when necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Test With Various Queries**\n",
    "   - Clear queries with all information\n",
    "   - Vague queries missing details\n",
    "   - Edge cases and error scenarios\n",
    "   - Multiple function calls in one request\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Consider Cost**\n",
    "   - Each function call = multiple API requests (initial + final)\n",
    "   - Monitor token usage carefully\n",
    "   - Cache results when appropriate\n",
    "   - Use cheaper models (like gpt-5-nano) when possible\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Use Mock Functions for Learning/Testing**\n",
    "   - Develop with mock data before connecting real APIs\n",
    "   - Test function calling logic without external dependencies\n",
    "   - Add real API calls only after logic is solid\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Maintain Conversation Context Properly**\n",
    "   - Always append messages, don't create new conversations\n",
    "   - Include both assistant message (tool call) and tool message (result)\n",
    "   - Preserve conversation history throughout the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Pro Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Batch Function Definitions**\n",
    "Create a separate file for function definitions and schemas:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# functions.py\n",
    "def get_weather(...):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "WEATHER_TOOLS = [ ... ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This keeps your main code clean and organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Log Function Calls**\n",
    "In production, log:\n",
    "- Which functions are being called\n",
    "- What parameters are being used\n",
    "- Execution time and results\n",
    "- Any errors that occur\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps debug issues and understand usage patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Version Your Function Schemas**\n",
    "If you change function signatures, version them:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"get_weather_v2\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "This prevents breaking changes for existing implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Add Parameter Validation**\n",
    "Even though the LLM should provide valid parameters, validate them in your functions:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_weather(location, format):\n",
    "    if format not in [\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"]:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Invalid format\")\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ What NOT to Do\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Don't Start New Conversations**\n",
    "❌ Creating a fresh message list for each API call\n",
    "✅ Append to the same messages list throughout the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Don't Forget to Parse Arguments**\n",
    "❌ Using `tool_call.function.arguments` directly (it's a string!)\n",
    "✅ Parse with `json.loads()` first\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Don't Return Non-String Content in Tool Messages**\n",
    "❌ `\"content\": function_result` (dict)\n",
    "✅ `\"content\": json.dumps(function_result)` (string)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Don't Make Function Descriptions Too Vague**\n",
    "❌ \"Get weather\" (too vague, when should this be used?)\n",
    "✅ \"Get the current weather in a given location. Use this for present conditions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Don't Ignore Errors**\n",
    "❌ Letting exceptions crash your application\n",
    "✅ Catch errors and handle them gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎓 Summary: What You've Learned\n",
