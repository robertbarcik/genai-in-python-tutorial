    "# 📚 Generating Knowledge Base Articles from Support Tickets\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "- Transform messy support ticket notes into professional knowledge base articles\n",
    "- Use OpenAI's API to automate documentation creation\n",
    "- Validate and quality-check generated content\n",
    "- Generate multiple formats (KB articles, runbooks, email templates) from the same source\n",
    "- Track and optimize API costs\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Support teams face a recurring challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔴 The Problem:**\n",
    "- Support agents solve the same issues repeatedly\n",
    "- Knowledge is trapped in ticket notes (messy, inconsistent, full of jargon)\n",
    "- Ticket notes are written for technicians, not end-users\n",
    "- Users can't self-serve, creating high ticket volume\n",
    "- Manual KB article writing is time-consuming and often gets deprioritized\n",
    "\n",
    "**🟢 The Solution:**\n",
    "- LLMs can transform technical ticket notes into polished, user-friendly guides\n",
    "- Automated generation makes it feasible to document every common issue\n",
    "- Users get self-service resources, reducing ticket volume\n",
    "- Support teams can focus on complex issues instead of repetitive ones\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cost Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Key Point**: We'll use `gpt-5-nano` for all examples in this notebook. Generating one KB article typically costs ~500-800 tokens, making it very affordable to document your entire knowledge base.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Use the right model**: `gpt-5-nano` is perfect for draft generation (20-30x cheaper than GPT-4)\n",
    "2. **Set appropriate max_tokens**: Avoid over-generation by setting realistic limits (800 for ~500 words)\n",
    "3. **Batch processing**: Process during off-peak hours if you have high volume\n",
    "4. **Cache common sections**: Store and reuse troubleshooting templates when applicable\n",
    "5. **Filter before generating**: Only generate articles for frequently occurring issues\n",
    "6. **Progressive enhancement**: Generate basic articles with gpt-5-nano, use GPT-4 only for critical/complex topics"

    "✅ **Do:**\n",
    "- Keep articles focused (one issue per article)\n",
    "- Validate article quality before publishing\n",
    "- Use consistent naming for easy organization\n",
    "- Track generation costs for budgeting\n",
    "- Review generated content before making public\n",
    "- Update articles as solutions evolve\n",
    "- Include screenshots or placeholders for visuals\n",
    "- Test instructions yourself before publishing\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Review Carefully:**\n",
    "- Security-sensitive procedures (password resets, access controls)\n",
    "- Complex, multi-system issues\n",
    "- Compliance-related documentation\n",
    "- Instructions involving user data\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Not Suitable For:**\n",
    "- Issues requiring case-by-case judgment\n",
    "- Problems without established solutions\n",
    "- Highly variable scenarios\n",
    "- Emergency procedures (require human oversight)\n",
