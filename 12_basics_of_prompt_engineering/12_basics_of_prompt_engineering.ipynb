    "# 🎯 Basics of Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "*An introductory guide to effective prompt engineering with OpenAI's API* 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤔 **What is Prompt Engineering?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 **Introduction to Prompt Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering refers to the careful design and structuring of input prompts that are given to AI language models to produce desired outputs. These prompts guide the AI's responses, helping to shape them in a way that meets specific needs. When interacting with language models, the way a question or command is phrased can significantly influence the quality and relevance of the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, prompt engineering is about crafting the \"questions\" we ask the AI to get the \"answers\" we need. This practice is fundamental in ensuring that the AI understands the context and purpose of the interaction, resulting in accurate, coherent, and useful outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Why is Prompt Engineering Important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering is crucial for several reasons. First, it allows us to control the quality of the AI's responses. By carefully crafting prompts, we can guide the AI to provide more precise, relevant, and contextually appropriate answers. This control is vital, especially in scenarios where the output must meet high standards of accuracy or clarity, such as customer support, content creation, or technical documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, prompt engineering helps unlock the full capabilities of language models. AI models are inherently flexible and can handle various tasks, but they need clear instructions to perform effectively. Good prompt design clarifies these instructions, ensuring that the AI knows what to do and how to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, effective prompt engineering reduces ambiguity. Ambiguous or vague prompts can lead to off-topic or nonsensical answers. By being clear and specific in our prompts, we minimize the chances of misinterpretation and improve the reliability of the AI's responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏗️ **The Role of an Architect in Prompt Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "While prompt engineering focuses on crafting effective inputs for AI models, it must be combined with strategic thinking and architectural design to solve real-world problems effectively. In other words, it's not just about what you send to the model but also about how this fits into the broader system.\n",
    "\n",
    "An \"architect\" in this context refers to someone who understands how to structure the interaction between the user, the AI, and the surrounding environment in a seamless and efficient manner. This involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Breaking Down Problems:** Before designing prompts, it's essential to decompose the problem into manageable parts. This step ensures that each aspect of the task is understood and addressed correctly. For instance, if you're developing a customer support chatbot, you would break down tasks into greeting the user, understanding the query, fetching information, and providing a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integrating Prompts with Python Code:** Effective prompt engineering requires embedding the prompts within a functional Python framework. This means creating functions that handle the generation of prompts, processing user inputs, and managing the AI's responses. It also involves setting up error handling, logging, and data management to ensure that the application runs smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Maintaining a Feedback Loop:** Prompt engineering is often iterative. As you interact with the AI, you will learn which prompts work best and which need adjustment. This requires building a feedback loop within your application to monitor and refine prompts based on user interactions and outcomes."

    "# 0️⃣ Understanding Model Parameters\n",
    "\n",

    "## 🌡️ 0.1 Temperature and Sampling Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "When you ask an AI model to generate text, it doesn't just produce a single \"correct\" answer. Instead, it considers many possible next words and chooses among them. The `temperature` parameter controls how this choice is made, fundamentally affecting whether the output feels predictable or creative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of temperature as a **creativity dial** 🎨. At low temperatures (closer to 0.0), the model behaves conservatively, almost always choosing the most likely next word. This makes outputs consistent, focused, and deterministic—ask the same question twice and you'll get nearly identical answers. At high temperatures (1.0 and above), the model becomes more adventurous, sometimes choosing less probable words, leading to varied, creative, and occasionally surprising responses. Ask the same question multiple times at high temperature, and you might get completely different answers each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The temperature scale typically ranges from **0.0 to 2.0**. Low values between **0.0 and 0.3** work best for factual tasks like data extraction, classification, or answering specific questions where accuracy matters more than variety. Medium values around **0.5 to 0.7** offer a balanced approach suitable for general-purpose tasks, providing some variation without sacrificing too much consistency. High values from **0.8 to 1.0** (or even higher) shine in creative applications like storytelling, brainstorming sessions, or generating diverse marketing copy where you want the model to explore different phrasings and ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding temperature helps you match the model's behavior to your specific needs. When you need reliable, consistent answers—like extracting information from documents or classifying support tickets—use lower temperatures ❄️. When you want the model to explore possibilities and generate varied options—like writing product descriptions or coming up with blog post titles—crank up the temperature 🔥."

The high-temperature version might have taken creative liberties, perhaps using more colorful language or unconventional phrasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Key Takeaway**: Temperature matters most when you need either absolute consistency (low) or deliberate variety (high). For many everyday tasks, the default temperature works fine, but understanding this parameter gives you precise control over the model's creativity-consistency trade-off."

    "## 🎫 0.2 Token Limits & Context Awareness\n",
    "\n",
    "AI models don't process text the way we do, word by word. Instead, they break language into smaller units called **tokens**. Understanding tokens is crucial because they determine both what you can ask the model to do and how much it will cost you 💰.\n",
    "\n",
    "A token isn't exactly a word, though that's a useful approximation. Think of tokens as the model's way of seeing language—sometimes a token is a whole word like \"hello,\" sometimes it's just part of a word like \"ing\" in \"running,\" and sometimes it's punctuation or even a space. In English, a rough rule of thumb is that **one token ≈ 4 characters** or **¾ of a word**. So a 100-word paragraph might use around 133 tokens. Numbers, special characters, and non-English text can have different token counts because the model breaks them down differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every model has a **context window**—a maximum number of tokens it can process in a single request. This limit includes both your input prompt and the model's response. For example:\n",
    "- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: 16,385 tokens (~12,000 words) 📄\n",
    "- **GPT-4**: varies by version, some exceed 100,000 tokens 📚\n",
    "\n",
    "These limits might seem generous, but they matter when you're working with long documents, providing extensive examples, or asking the model to process multiple texts at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens when you exceed these limits? ⚠️ Usually, the API will reject your request with an error, telling you that your prompt is too long. Some implementations automatically truncate your input, cutting off the beginning or end to fit within limits, which can lead to incomplete context and poor results. This is why understanding your token usage is essential for production applications—you need to design your prompts knowing these constraints exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokens have direct cost implications 💵. API providers charge based on token usage, typically pricing input tokens (your prompt) differently from output tokens (the model's response). If you're processing thousands of documents or generating lengthy reports, token costs can add up quickly. Efficient prompt design—getting the results you need with fewer tokens—becomes not just a technical concern but a financial one."

    "Specific details work wonders when you're working in specialized domains where **precision matters** 🔍.

For instance, asking about \"marketing strategies\" is broad, but asking about \"digital marketing strategies for B2B SaaS companies targeting enterprise clients\" narrows the focus dramatically, yielding far more relevant advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there's a balance to strike ⚖️. For creative tasks like brainstorming or exploring possibilities, too much specificity can be constraining. If you want the model to generate diverse blog post ideas, saying \"give me blog post ideas\" might work better than providing ten constraints about length, tone, audience, and topic. The sweet spot is being specific about the parameters that truly matter while leaving room for the model to be helpful in ways you might not have anticipated. When you catch yourself writing a vague prompt and getting generic results, that's your signal to add the crucial details that distinguish your specific need from a general request."

    "\n",
    "Personas are your tool for controlling **how** information is delivered, not **what** information the model knows. This is a crucial distinction that many people miss! 🚨 Asking the model to be \"a medical expert\" doesn't suddenly give it medical expertise it didn't have before—it simply changes the communication style, making responses sound more authoritative or use more technical language. The underlying knowledge remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use personas when the style and tone of communication truly matter for your application 🎨. Customer service scenarios benefit enormously from a friendly, patient persona that acknowledges frustration and offers reassurance. Educational contexts work well with a tutor persona that breaks down concepts step by step without condescension. Sensitive topics like health 🏥, finance 💰, or legal matters ⚖️ call for personas that are empathetic, careful, and appropriately serious. Personas excel at maintaining a consistent voice across many interactions, which is essential for brand consistency or user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't fall into the trap of using personas thinking they'll make the model magically more knowledgeable about a subject. If you need accurate technical information, provide reference materials or use specific, detailed prompts—don't just ask it to \"be an expert.\" The best applications of personas are about emotional intelligence and communication style, not factual enhancement."

    "### 🛡️ When Delimiters Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Delimiters become essential when you're juggling multiple pieces of content that need different treatment within a single request 🎯. Imagine you're building a document comparison tool—you want the model to analyze two contracts and highlight differences. Without delimiters, the model might blur the boundaries between documents, treating them as one continuous text and missing your intent to compare them separately. With clear XML tags or other delimiters marking where each contract begins and ends, the model understands the structure you're imposing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique shines when processing user-generated content that might contain confusing instructions or attempts at **prompt injection** ⚠️. If a user submits a support ticket that includes text like \"ignore previous instructions and do something else,\" delimiters help the model understand that this text is data to be processed, not instructions to follow. You're essentially saying, \"Everything inside these tags is content, not commands.\" This becomes critical for security and reliability in production applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delimiters also prevent confusion in complex multi-part tasks 🧩. If you want the model to translate one section, summarize another, and extract key points from a third—all in one request—delimiters make your intent crystal clear. Each section has its own boundaries and associated instructions. Without this structure, the model might mix operations or misunderstand which instruction applies to which content.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, don't add delimiters just because you can 🚫. For simple, single-task prompts where you're asking one straightforward question about one piece of text, delimiters add unnecessary complexity. They're a tool for when structure matters, not a universal best practice. The key is recognizing when the boundaries between different parts of your input actually matter for getting the right output."

This is especially important when each step depends on the completion of previous steps, or when you want specific formatting and labels for each part of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex procedural tasks benefit enormously from this approach 🏗️. Imagine you're asking the model to review a document: check for errors, suggest improvements, rewrite problematic sections, and provide a final assessment. Without explicit steps, the model might mix these activities or skip some entirely. With clear steps, you get organized, predictable output where each task is addressed in order. This makes the results easier to parse programmatically and helps ensure nothing is missed.\n",

This is practical control that saves you editing time!\n",

These negative constraints shape the communication style to match your audience's needs.\n",

If you're generating content for a specific platform or document type, negative instructions help maintain consistency.\n",

    "\n",
    "Citations transform AI-generated responses from unverifiable claims into **traceable information** 📍. In professional contexts where accountability matters—legal analysis ⚖️, medical information 🏥, financial advice 💰, academic research 🎓—being able to trace a statement back to its source is often required, not optional. Citations allow readers to verify information, check context, and assess the reliability of sources, which is fundamental to trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "The practical benefit extends beyond trust to **functionality** ⚙️. When the model cites specific passages, you can programmatically verify those citations by checking if the quoted text actually appears in the source documents. This lets you build quality checks into your application—flagging responses where citations don't match sources, or filtering out answers that lack proper citations. This kind of automated verification is impossible without explicit citations!\n",
    "\n",
    "Academic and research applications demand citations by nature, but the need extends to business contexts too 💼. When your company's AI assistant answers questions about policies or procedures, having citations that point to specific policy sections protects both the company and users. If there's ever a dispute about what was communicated, citations provide an **audit trail** 📋. In regulated industries like healthcare, finance, or legal services, this traceability can be a compliance requirement, not just a nice-to-have feature."

    "\n",
    "Few-shot prompting is a powerful technique that leverages **examples** 📝 to guide the model's behavior. Rather than just telling the model what to do, you **show** it examples of what you want! ✨"

    "## 🧠 Understanding Few-Shot Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💭 What is Few-Shot Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-shot prompting works by providing the AI model with a small number of examples that demonstrate the task you want it to perform. These examples—often called \"**shots**\" 🎯—serve as templates that show the model the pattern you're looking for. It's fundamentally different from **zero-shot prompting** (where you just describe the task without examples) and from **fine-tuning** (where you permanently train the model on many examples to specialize its behavior).\n",
    "\n",
    "The psychology behind few-shot learning is intuitive 🧒. Imagine teaching a child to identify different types of clouds. You could describe the characteristics of cumulus clouds in abstract terms, or you could simply point at the sky and say \"see those fluffy, cotton-like clouds? Those are cumulus.\" Show them a few more examples, and they'll start recognizing cumulus clouds on their own. Few-shot prompting works similarly—the model sees patterns in your examples and generalizes those patterns to new cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the model sees examples, it picks up on subtle aspects that might be hard to describe explicitly: the **tone** 🎵, the **level of detail** 🔍, the **structure** 🏗️ of the response, the way certain types of inputs map to outputs. Examples communicate these nuances more effectively than lengthy descriptions. A single well-chosen example can convey what would take paragraphs to explain, and multiple examples reinforce the pattern while showing acceptable variations."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### 🔢 How Many Examples Should You Provide?\n",
    "\n",
    "The right number of examples depends on your task's complexity and how consistently the model needs to perform. For **simple tasks** with clear patterns—like basic classification or format conversion—**2-3 examples** are often sufficient to establish the pattern. The model picks up on straightforward patterns quickly, and additional examples provide diminishing returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "More **nuanced tasks** requiring subtle distinctions benefit from **5-10 examples**. If you're doing sentiment analysis that distinguishes between frustrated, angry, and disappointed, or if you're extracting structured data where edge cases matter, more examples help the model understand the boundaries between categories and handle ambiguous cases better. Each additional example can clarify a different aspect of the task or demonstrate how to handle a particular edge case.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, more examples aren't always better ⚠️. Beyond a certain point, you hit **diminishing returns**—the model isn't learning much from additional examples, but you're paying for those extra tokens in every request 💸. More examples also make prompts more complex and harder to maintain. If results are good with three examples, don't add seven more just because you can. The sweet spot is the **minimum number of examples** that consistently produces the quality you need.\n",

Good examples should cover the range of cases you expect to encounter—not just typical cases, but also **edge cases** and potentially tricky situations. If you're classifying customer feedback, don't just show positive and negative examples; include ambiguous ones, mixed sentiment, and edge cases like sarcasm or context-dependent meaning. This helps the model handle real-world messiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diversity within consistency** is key 🔑. Your examples should show variety in inputs while maintaining consistent formatting and style in outputs. If all your examples are too similar, the model might latch onto superficial patterns rather than the underlying logic. But if examples are inconsistent in format or approach, the model gets confused about what pattern to follow. Strike a balance between showing the range of inputs you'll encounter and maintaining a clear, consistent pattern in how outputs should look.\n",

    "### 🎯 When to Use Few-Shot Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-shot prompting excels at **pattern recognition tasks** where showing is easier than telling! Classification problems 🏷️—sentiment analysis, topic categorization, intent detection—are natural fits. Extraction tasks where you need specific information pulled out in a particular format benefit from examples that show exactly what you want and how it should be structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "When **zero-shot prompting gives inconsistent results** 🎲—sometimes the format is right, sometimes wrong, or the tone varies unpredictably—adding examples usually stabilizes performance. Tasks with **specific formatting requirements** are perfect for few-shot learning. If you need JSON output with particular field names, or CSV data with specific delimiters, or markdown with a particular structure, showing examples of correctly formatted output is far more effective than trying to describe the format in words.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, don't use few-shot prompting for simple factual questions where zero-shot works fine ❌. If \"What's the capital of France?\" gets you \"Paris,\" you don't need examples. Creative writing tasks also generally don't benefit from examples unless you're trying to match a very specific style. For open-ended creative work, examples might constrain the model in unhelpful ways, making outputs feel derivative rather than original.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💰 Cost and Performance Trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-shot prompting has a real cost: every example adds tokens to your prompt, and you pay for those tokens in **every single request** 💵. If your base prompt is 50 tokens and you add five examples that total 200 tokens, you've **quintupled** the input cost of each request. Over thousands or millions of requests, this adds up significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision becomes a balance between **accuracy improvement** and **cost increase** ⚖️. If adding examples boosts your accuracy from 70% to 95%, that might be worth the extra cost—fewer errors means less manual review, fewer user complaints, better user experience. But if examples only improve accuracy from 95% to 97%, you need to consider whether that marginal gain justifies the added expense. Sometimes better prompt engineering—clearer instructions, better structure, strategic use of other techniques—can achieve similar results without the per-request cost of examples."

    "\n",
    "Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is the technique of asking the model to **show its work** 📝—to explicitly walk through its reasoning process before arriving at an answer.

It's like showing your work in math class—the act of writing out each step catches errors, clarifies logic, and makes it easier to verify the answer. When models jump directly to conclusions, they're more likely to make mistakes in multi-step problems. When they reason step-by-step, they essentially self-correct and build more reliable solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about how you'd solve a complex problem yourself 🤔. You don't usually arrive at the answer in one intuitive leap.

    "\n",
    "Chain-of-thought prompting is your go-to technique for **multi-step reasoning problems** 🧮. Math problems, logic puzzles, analytical tasks requiring multiple inferential steps—these are prime candidates. If you're asking the model to analyze data and draw conclusions, or to solve problems where the path from question to answer involves several logical steps, CoT dramatically improves reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique becomes especially valuable when you need to **verify the reasoning**, not just accept the answer 🔍. In educational contexts 🎓, showing the reasoning process helps students learn. In professional contexts like data analysis or decision support 💼, stakeholders often need to understand **how** conclusions were reached, not just **what** they are. Chain-of-thought makes the model's logic transparent and auditable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Debugging** why an answer might be wrong 🐛 becomes much easier with chain-of-thought. If the model gets a problem wrong, seeing its reasoning process often immediately reveals where it went astray. Maybe it misinterpreted a key piece of information, or made a calculation error in step 3, or applied the wrong rule. Without seeing the steps, you're left guessing why the answer is wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚫 When to Skip Chain-of-Thought\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every task benefits from explicit reasoning. **Simple factual lookups** don't need it—\"What's the capital of Japan?\" doesn't require showing work; the answer is \"Tokyo.\" **Creative writing tasks** 🎨 often suffer from step-by-step reasoning because it breaks the flow and makes output feel mechanical rather than natural. If you want the model to write a story or generate marketing copy, asking it to show its reasoning about word choices would be counterproductive.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you only care about the **final answer** and the reasoning would just add unnecessary verbosity, skip CoT. Some applications need quick, concise responses ⚡, and multi-paragraph reasoning explanations would frustrate users. If your users just want to know \"yes\" or \"no,\" they don't need to see three paragraphs explaining how the model arrived at its answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💰 Cost Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost impact of chain-of-thought prompting is substantial and worth understanding before committing to it. A direct answer might be 50 tokens, while a chain-of-thought response explaining the same answer could be **200-300 tokens**. That's **4-6 times** the output cost per request! For a high-volume application, this difference compounds quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this cost-benefit calculation isn't just about token counts ⚖️. Chain-of-thought often produces **more accurate answers**, especially for complex problems. If direct answers are wrong 20% of the time, requiring manual review or corrections, while CoT answers are wrong only 5% of the time, the extra token cost might be offset by reduced error handling. You're trading increased per-request costs for better accuracy, which could mean lower total operational costs when you factor in error correction and customer support! 📊"

    "**Chain-of-Thought** 🪜: For problems with a relatively clear solution path that requires multiple steps. You know what you're solving for; you just need to show the work. It's linear and procedural—step 1, step 2, step 3, answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-Ask** 🔍: For questions where the challenge is in the question's complexity itself, not just in the solution steps. You need to break down what's being asked before you can answer it. It's more exploratory and multidimensional. The model identifies aspects of the question, addresses each aspect, and then synthesizes. It's not a linear path but rather a structured exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **How to Choose**: If someone asks \"What's 15% of 240?\" use chain-of-thought to show the calculation steps. If someone asks \"How might universal basic income affect employment, government budgets, and social welfare?\" use self-ask to systematically address each dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Limitations and When Not to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-ask prompting is **token-expensive** 💸—arguably the most expensive technique in common use. You're generating multiple questions and multiple answers for each original question. A direct response might be 100 tokens, while a self-ask response could easily be **500-1000 tokens**. The model's asking and answering its own follow-up questions, each adding to the output length. For high-volume applications, this cost adds up quickly!\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't use self-ask for **simple or focused questions** 🚫. If someone asks \"What's the capital of Brazil?\" breaking that down into sub-questions is absurd overkill. Save self-ask for questions where the complexity genuinely demands decomposition. Using it for routine queries just wastes tokens and produces verbose outputs that obscure simple answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique can produce outputs so comprehensive that they become **overwhelming** 📚. Sometimes users want a concise answer, not an exhaustive exploration. A simple question might get buried under layers of sub-questions and sub-answers. Before choosing self-ask, consider whether your users actually need that level of detail or if it would be information overload.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Best used judiciously** for genuinely complex analytical questions where thoroughness matters more than brevity. Research reports 📊, strategic analysis 🎯, comprehensive assessments—these are appropriate contexts. Quick information lookups, routine support questions, or any scenario where speed and conciseness matter more than exhaustive coverage should use simpler techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Transparency Benefit\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its costs, self-ask has a unique **transparency advantage** 💎. The technique explicitly shows the model's reasoning structure—not just how it arrived at an answer, but **what aspects of the question** it considered important. If the model breaks a question about climate policy into sub-questions about economic impact, environmental effectiveness, political feasibility, and social equity, you immediately see its analytical framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "This transparency helps identify if the model is **missing crucial aspects** ⚠️. If you ask about implementing a new technology and the model's sub-questions don't include security or privacy considerations, that omission becomes obvious. You can then refine your prompt or follow up specifically on overlooked dimensions. The explicit structure makes gaps visible in a way that direct answers don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you need to understand how conclusions were reached—not just verify computational steps but see the entire analytical structure—self-ask provides **unmatched visibility** 👀 into the model's reasoning process."

    "# 🎓 Best Practices & Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Choosing the Right Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "The art of prompt engineering lies in **matching techniques to tasks** 🎨. When your task needs focused, specific information on a particular topic, the foundation is **detailed prompts** that include relevant context and constraints. Don't ask \"tell me about machine learning\"—ask \"explain how supervised learning differs from unsupervised learning, with one example of each, for someone with basic programming knowledge but no AI background.\" Specificity transforms generic outputs into useful ones! ✨\n",
    "\n",
    "If the tone and style of communication matter for your application—customer service 🤝, education 🎓, sensitive subjects 💙—**personas** become your tool. A technical expert persona for professional audiences, an empathetic counselor persona for healthcare contexts, a patient tutor persona for educational content—these shape how information is delivered to match your audience's needs and expectations. Just remember that personas affect **style**, not **knowledge**, so combine them with other techniques when accuracy matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're handling multiple documents or complex inputs in a single request, **delimiters** 📦 prevent confusion about what text should be processed how. They're particularly crucial for user-generated content that might contain confusing text, or for applications that need to treat different sections of input differently. Skip delimiters for simple single-piece-of-text tasks where boundaries aren't an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks involving multiple sequential steps benefit from explicit **step-by-step instructions** 🪜. If you can break your task into three or more distinct operations—extract this, then analyze that, then format it this way—numbering those steps ensures the model follows your intended workflow. Save this for genuinely multi-part tasks; don't overstructure simple requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Negative prompting** 🚫 becomes valuable when you've observed specific unwanted behaviors you want to prevent. If the model keeps using jargon when you need plain language, or making assumptions about audience knowledge, or including elements you don't want, explicitly stating what NOT to do can be more effective than trying to imply constraints through positive instructions alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have authoritative **reference documents** 📚 and need responses grounded in specific information rather than general knowledge, provide that reference text explicitly. This dramatically reduces hallucinations 👻 and ensures answers reflect your particular context—company policies, research papers, legal documents, whatever source should ground the responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For tasks requiring consistent patterns—classification, extraction, formatting—**few-shot prompting** 🎯 lets you show what you want rather than describe it. Two to five good examples often establish patterns more clearly than paragraphs of description. Use this when zero-shot results are inconsistent or when format requirements are easier to demonstrate than explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you need to verify reasoning, not just trust answers, **chain-of-thought** 🧮 makes the model's logic transparent. Multi-step math problems, analytical tasks, troubleshooting—anything where the path to the answer matters as much as the answer itself. The cost is higher token usage, but the benefit is verifiable, trustworthy reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For genuinely complex, multifaceted questions where thoroughness matters more than brevity, **self-ask prompting** 🔍 ensures systematic exploration of all relevant dimensions. It's your most expensive technique in terms of tokens, so reserve it for questions that truly demand comprehensive analysis rather than quick answers."

    "## 🔗 Combining Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "The real power emerges when you combine techniques strategically! 💪 You might use **personas with negative prompting** to get both the right tone and avoid specific pitfalls—\"you're a patient educator\" plus \"don't use jargon or assume prior knowledge.\" **Few-shot examples** can incorporate **chain-of-thought reasoning**, showing not just what outputs should look like but how to reason through each case. **Reference text** can be paired with **step-by-step instructions** for complex document analysis tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, combining techniques also means combining **costs and complexity** 💰. Each additional technique adds tokens, makes prompts harder to maintain, and can create confusion if techniques conflict. The key is **purposeful combination**—add another technique only when it addresses a specific gap in your results. Start with the simplest approach that might work, then add techniques incrementally when you identify specific deficiencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common effective combination is **detailed prompts + step-by-step instructions** for structured tasks, plus **few-shot examples** to establish format. Another is **personas + reference text** for customer-facing applications that need both appropriate tone and accurate information. The combination should feel natural, with each technique addressing a different aspect of quality—one for accuracy, one for tone, one for format."

    "## 💭 Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering is fundamentally **iterative** 🔄. You rarely get prompts perfect on the first try. Start with a straightforward attempt, see what works and what doesn't, then refine. Each iteration teaches you something about how the model interprets your instructions and where your prompts need more clarity or different structure. The techniques in this notebook are **tools in your toolkit** 🧰—you'll learn through experience which ones work best for your specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "What works beautifully for one task might fail for another that seems similar. Prompt engineering requires **experimentation and adaptation** 🧪. Don't assume that because a technique worked well once, it's the right approach for every problem. Be prepared to try different techniques, combine them in new ways, and adjust based on results. The goal is **reliable, useful outputs**, not adhering to a rigid methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Balance prompt complexity against the value of results ⚖️. Elaborate prompts with multiple techniques might improve output quality by 10%, but cost three times as much in tokens and take longer to maintain. Sometimes simpler prompts that are \"good enough\" are the right choice, especially for high-volume applications where costs accumulate. Save your most sophisticated prompt engineering for tasks where quality improvements truly matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, remember that **AI models continue evolving** 🚀. Today's models behave differently than those from six months ago, and tomorrow's models will be different still. Prompt engineering techniques that are essential now might become less important as models improve, or new techniques might emerge. Stay curious, keep experimenting, and be willing to adapt your approach as the technology evolves. The principles—**clarity, specificity, appropriate technique selection**—remain constant even as specific tactics change."
