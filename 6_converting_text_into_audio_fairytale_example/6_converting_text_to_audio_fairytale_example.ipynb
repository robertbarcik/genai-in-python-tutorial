    "\n",
    "Text-to-Speech technology analyzes written text and generates synthetic speech that sounds natural and human-like. The process involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text Analysis**: Breaking down the text into words, sentences, and punctuation\n",
    "2. **Pronunciation**: Determining how each word should be pronounced\n",
    "3. **Prosody Generation**: Adding natural rhythm, intonation, and pacing\n",
    "4. **Audio Synthesis**: Creating the actual audio waveform\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Tips for Great Audio Stories\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Good for TTS**:\n",
    "- Clear, grammatically correct sentences\n",
    "- Proper punctuation (helps with pacing and dramatic pauses)\n",
    "- Standard words and common expressions\n",
    "- Well-formatted text with natural flow\n",
    "- Descriptive language that paints a picture\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Problematic for TTS**:\n",
    "- Excessive special characters (@, #, $, etc.)\n",
    "- All caps text (may sound like shouting)\n",
    "- Unclear formatting or run-on sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Key TTS API Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`model`**: `tts-1` (standard quality, cost-effective)\n",
    "- **`voice`**: Choose from 6 voices (alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer)\n",
    "- **`input`**: The text to convert to speech\n",
    "- **`response_format`**: Audio format - `mp3` (default)"
