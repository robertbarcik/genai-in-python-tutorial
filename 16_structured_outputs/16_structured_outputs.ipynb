    "\n",
    "OpenAI offers two main approaches to get structured outputs from language models:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Function Calling** (Covered in Notebook 13)\n",
    "- The model requests function execution\n",
    "- You parse the function arguments\n",
    "- Useful when you want the model to trigger actions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Response Formats** (Focus of This Notebook) ‚ú®\n",
    "- The model responds **directly in structured JSON**\n",
    "- No function calls - just get the data you need\n",
    "- Simpler for pure data extraction tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Why Use Response Formats?\n",
    "\n",
    "Response formats are perfect when you want to:\n",
    "- **Extract information** from text (emails, documents, descriptions)\n",
    "- **Parse unstructured data** into structured forms\n",
    "- **Generate structured content** (product listings, event details, user profiles)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üåü Key Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Type Safety** üõ°Ô∏è - Get guaranteed data types (integers stay integers, not strings)\n",
    "2. **Consistency** üìè - Field names and structure stay the same every time\n",
    "3. **Explicit Refusals** üö´ - The model can refuse to output when appropriate\n",
    "4. **Simpler Prompting** ‚úçÔ∏è - No need to write detailed formatting instructions\n",
    "5. **Production Ready** üè≠ - Reliable enough for real applications\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° Key Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response formats are ideal for data extraction tasks** where you don't need the model to trigger functions or actions - you just want structured data back. Think of it as asking the model to fill out a form with specific fields!\n",

    "- Function calling is for triggering actions; response formats are for getting structured data\n",

   "source": [
    "## 2.1 The Old Way - Prompting for JSON ‚ö†Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìñ What is Prompt-Based JSON?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before structured outputs became available, the only way to get JSON responses from language models was to simply ask for it in your prompt. You would write something like \"return the result as JSON\" or \"extract this information in JSON format with fields X, Y, and Z\" and hope the model would comply. While this approach often worked, it came with significant limitations that made it unsuitable for production applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üö® The Core Problem: No Guaranteed Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental issue with prompt-based JSON is that **you have no control over the output structure**. The model tries its best to follow your instructions, but it interprets them probabilistically. Each time you make the same request, the model might make slightly different decisions about how to format the response, leading to inconsistent outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üíî Major Limitations and Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Inconsistent Field Names**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when you explicitly specify field names in your prompt, the model might use variations. For example, if you ask for a \"price\" field, one response might use `\"price\"`, another might use `\"cost\"`, and yet another might use `\"product_price\"` or `\"unit_price\"`. This inconsistency breaks your parsing code, as you can't reliably access the data without checking multiple possible field names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Unpredictable Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "Type consistency is another major problem. A price value might come back as a number (`49.99`) in one response and as a string (`\"$49.99\"` or `\"49.99\"`) in another. This makes it impossible to perform calculations or comparisons without extensive type checking and conversion logic. The same applies to booleans (might get `true`, `\"true\"`, `\"yes\"`, or `1`) and integers (might get `2024` or `\"2024\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Missing or Extra Fields**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model might decide to omit fields you requested if it thinks the information isn't available or isn't important. Conversely, it might add extra fields that you didn't ask for, thinking they would be helpful. This variability means you can't rely on a consistent structure when processing the responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Structural Variations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond individual fields, the overall structure might change. Sometimes the model returns a flat object, other times it nests related fields into sub-objects. For example, you might get `{\"price\": 49.99, \"currency\": \"USD\"}` in one response and `{\"price\": {\"amount\": 49.99, \"currency\": \"USD\"}}` in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Invalid JSON**\n",
    "\n",
    "While modern models are generally good at producing valid JSON syntax, there's still no guarantee. The model might occasionally produce malformed JSON that fails to parse, especially with complex nested structures or when handling special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚öôÔ∏è Why This Happens\n",
    "\n",
    "These inconsistencies aren't bugs‚Äîthey're inherent to how language models work. Models generate text probabilistically, token by token. Without explicit constraints, the model makes independent decisions about field names, types, and structure based on its training and the context. Even with detailed prompting, you're relying on the model's interpretation rather than enforcing rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìâ Impact on Production Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "For production applications, these limitations are deal-breakers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unreliable parsing**: Your code needs complex error handling to account for all possible variations\n",
    "- **Fragile integrations**: APIs and databases expect consistent data structures\n",
    "- **Difficult debugging**: When something breaks, you need to handle countless edge cases\n",
    "- **Maintenance burden**: As your prompts evolve, you might introduce new variations\n",
    "- **No type safety**: You can't leverage static type checking or validation libraries effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, developers would resort to extensive post-processing: checking multiple field name variations, converting string numbers to actual numbers, validating that required fields exist, and handling unexpected structures. This adds complexity, increases the chance of bugs, and makes the system harder to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "While prompt-based JSON works for quick prototypes or one-off tasks, it's fundamentally unreliable for production use. The lack of guaranteed structure means you're constantly fighting against variability instead of building on a solid foundation. This is precisely why structured outputs with JSON Schema were introduced‚Äîto give developers the control and consistency they need for real-world applications."

    "## 2.2 The Modern Way - `json_schema` with Responses API ‚ú®\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ The Solution: Structured Outputs with JSON Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these limitations with prompt-based JSON, OpenAI introduced **structured outputs** using JSON Schema. This feature fundamentally changes the game by allowing you to define an explicit schema that the model must follow. Instead of hoping the model interprets your prompt correctly, you provide a formal specification that guarantees consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "With structured outputs, you define exactly what fields you want, their data types, which fields are required, and even constraints like enums for fixed choices. The model then generates outputs that strictly conform to your schema‚Äîevery single time. This transforms language models from unpredictable text generators into reliable structured data extractors that you can build production systems on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîë The Responses API Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The Responses API uses a specific syntax for structured outputs. Instead of the `response_format` parameter used in Chat Completions, you use the `text` parameter with a nested `format` object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text={\n",
    "    \"format\": {\n",
    "        \"type\": \"json_schema\",\n",
    "        \"name\": \"schema_name\",\n",
    "        \"schema\": your_schema,\n",
    "        \"strict\": True\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This syntax is unique to the Responses API and is essential for getting structured outputs with models like `gpt-5-nano`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üåü The Magic Parameter: `strict: True`\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to reliable structured outputs is the `strict: True` parameter. This is what transforms the API from \"try to follow this schema\" to \"must follow this schema exactly.\" When you set `strict: True`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Field names are guaranteed** - Always exactly as you specified, never variations\n",
    "- **Data types are enforced** - Numbers are always numbers, strings are always strings, booleans are always booleans\n",
    "- **Required fields are present** - Every field you mark as required will be in the response\n",
    "- **No unexpected fields** - When using `additionalProperties: false`, only your defined fields appear\n",
    "- **Structure is consistent** - The same schema produces the same structure every time\n",
    "\n",
    "Without `strict: True`, you're back to the probabilistic behavior of the old way. With it, you get deterministic, type-safe outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Key Benefits Over Prompt-Based JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's compare what structured outputs give you:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Prompt-Based JSON ‚ùå | Structured Outputs ‚úÖ |\n",
    "|--------|---------------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| Field names | Vary between calls | Always consistent |\n",
    "| Data types | Unpredictable | Guaranteed |\n",
    "| Required fields | May be missing | Always present |\n",
    "| Extra fields | May appear | Prevented with additionalProperties: false |\n",
    "| Structure | Can vary | Fixed by schema |\n",
    "| Type safety | Impossible | Full support |\n",
    "| Production ready | No | Yes |\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìã How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use structured outputs with JSON Schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define your schema** - Specify the exact structure you want using JSON Schema format\n",
    "2. **Set strict mode** - Include `strict: True` to enforce the schema\n",
    "3. **Make the API call** - The model generates content that conforms to your schema\n",
    "4. **Parse with confidence** - You can trust the structure and types of the response\n",
    "\n",
    "The model understands your schema and generates tokens that are guaranteed to produce valid output matching your specification. This isn't post-processing or validation‚Äîit's built into the generation process itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üöÄ Ready for Production\n",
    "\n",
    "With structured outputs, you can:\n",
    "- Write parsing code once and trust it will always work\n",
    "- Integrate directly with databases and APIs\n",
    "- Use static type checking in your application\n",
    "- Validate data using your schema\n",
    "- Build reliable, maintainable systems\n",

    "\n",
    "JSON Schema supports several fundamental data types. Understanding which to use is crucial for reliable structured outputs!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **`string`** - Text data\n",
    "- Names, descriptions, URLs, emails, etc.\n",
    "- Example: `\"John Doe\"`, `\"hello@example.com\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **`integer`** - Whole numbers\n",
    "- Years, counts, IDs, quantities\n",
    "- Example: `2024`, `42`, `-5`\n",
    "- ‚ö†Ô∏è Use this, not `number`, when you need whole numbers only\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **`number`** - Decimal numbers\n",
    "- Prices, ratings, measurements, percentages\n",
    "- Example: `49.99`, `3.14`, `-2.5`\n",
    "- Can also represent integers, but `integer` is more precise\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **`boolean`** - True/false values\n",
    "- Flags, status indicators, yes/no questions\n",
    "- Example: `true`, `false`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **`array`** - Lists of items\n",
    "- Collections of things (tags, names, values)\n",
    "- Must specify what type of items: `\"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}`\n",
    "- Example: `[\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **`object`** - Nested structures\n",
    "- Complex data with its own fields\n",
    "- Example: `{\"street\": \"123 Main St\", \"city\": \"Boston\"}`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîê Required Fields\n",

    "- Other fields are optional\n",

    "### üîç Understanding Nested Structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üì¶ Array of Objects Pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"type\": \"array\",          // It's an array\n",
    "  \"items\": {                 // Each item in the array is:\n",
    "    \"type\": \"object\",        // An object\n",
    "    \"properties\": {          // With these fields:\n",
    "      \"field1\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n",
    "      \"field2\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}\n",

    "    \"additionalProperties\": false\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üéØ Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Array of Simple Values** (strings, numbers):\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   \"tags\": {\n",
    "     \"type\": \"array\",\n",
    "     \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}  // Just specify the type\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Result: `[\"tech\", \"startup\", \"AI\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Array of Objects** (complex items):\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   \"employees\": {\n",
    "     \"type\": \"array\",\n",
    "     \"items\": {\n",
    "       \"type\": \"object\",         // Each item is an object\n",
    "       \"properties\": {...},       // Define its structure\n",
    "       \"required\": [...]\n",
    "     }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Result: `[{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"role\": \"Dev\"}, {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"role\": \"PM\"}]`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Required Fields Apply to Each Object**:\n",
    "   - Set `required` inside the `items` definition\n",
    "   - Every object in the array must have those fields\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use `additionalProperties: false`** at both levels:\n",
    "   - Top level (main object)\n",
    "   - Nested level (objects within arrays)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Real-World Benefit:\n",
    "\n",
    "With nested structures, you can model complex entities accurately:\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Each leader has consistent fields (name, title, years)\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Easy to loop through and access\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Type-safe - years is always an integer\n",
    "- ‚úÖ No parsing headaches!\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nested structures model real-world hierarchical data\n",
    "- Use `\"type\": \"array\"` with `\"items\": {\"type\": \"object\"}` for arrays of complex items\n",
    "- Define `properties` and `required` within the `items` definition\n",
    "- Each object in the array follows the same schema\n",
    "- Set `additionalProperties: false` at all levels for strictness\n",
    "- Nested data is easy to work with in code (loops, accessing fields)"

    "# üéì Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéâ What You've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You now know how to get reliable, type-safe structured outputs from OpenAI's Responses API. Let's recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Response Formats** - The modern way to get structured JSON\n",
    "   - Prompt-based: Old way, inconsistent\n",
    "   - `json_schema` with `strict: True`: Modern way, reliable\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Responses API Syntax** - The correct way to use structured outputs\n",
    "   - Use `text={\"format\": {...}}` parameter\n",
    "   - NOT `response_format` (that's for Chat Completions API)\n",
    "   - Always include `\"strict\": True`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **JSON Schema Basics** - Defining structure and types\n",
    "   - Core types: string, integer, number, boolean, array, object\n",
    "   - Required fields and additionalProperties\n",
    "   - Field descriptions for clarity\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Complex Structures** - Real-world data modeling\n",
    "   - Arrays of simple values\n",
    "   - Arrays of objects (nested structures)\n",
    "   - Nullable fields for optional data\n",
    "   - Enums for fixed choices\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Best Practices** - Production-ready schemas\n",
    "   - Always use `strict: True`\n",
    "   - Choose specific data types\n",
    "   - Add descriptions to fields\n",
    "   - Handle missing data with nullable types\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Common Pitfalls** - What to avoid\n",
    "   - Forgetting `strict: True`\n",
    "   - Wrong data types\n",
    "   - Missing required fields\n",
    "   - Overcomplicating schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Where to Go From Here\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resume Parser** - Extract structured job history from resumes\n",
    "2. **Recipe Extractor** - Parse cooking recipes into structured format\n",
    "3. **Email Parser** - Extract action items and deadlines from emails\n",
    "4. **Invoice Parser** - Extract line items, totals, dates from invoices\n",
    "5. **Product Review Analyzer** - Extract ratings, pros, cons from reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration Ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a Slack bot that extracts meeting info and creates calendar events\n",
    "- Create a Chrome extension that extracts product details from any e-commerce site\n",
    "- Develop an email assistant that categorizes and extracts key information\n",
    "- Build a document processor that converts PDFs to structured data\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° Final Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start Simple** - Begin with basic schemas and add complexity gradually\n",
    "2. **Test with Real Data** - Don't just use perfect examples\n",
    "3. **Iterate** - Refine your schema based on actual results\n",
    "4. **Handle Errors** - Add try/except blocks for production code\n",
    "5. **Monitor Quality** - Check extraction accuracy over time\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Golden Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "üîë **Always use `strict: True`**\n",
    "\n",
    "üîë **Choose the most specific type**\n",
    "\n",
    "üîë **Set `additionalProperties: False`**\n",
    "\n",
    "üîë **Use nullable types for optional data**\n",
    "\n",
    "üîë **Keep schemas simple and focused**\n",
