    "## ü§î Two Ways to Get Structured Data\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI offers two main approaches to get structured outputs from language models:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Function Calling** (Covered in Notebook 13)\n",
    "- The model requests function execution\n",
    "- You parse the function arguments\n",
    "- Useful when you want the model to trigger actions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Response Formats** (Focus of This Notebook) ‚ú®\n",
    "- The model responds **directly in structured JSON**\n",
    "- No function calls - just get the data you need\n",
    "- Simpler for pure data extraction tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Why Use Response Formats?\n",
    "\n",
    "Response formats are perfect when you want to:\n",
    "- **Extract information** from text (emails, documents, descriptions)\n",
    "- **Parse unstructured data** into structured forms\n",
    "- **Generate structured content** (product listings, event details, user profiles)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üåü Key Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Type Safety** üõ°Ô∏è - Get guaranteed data types (integers stay integers, not strings)\n",
    "2. **Consistency** üìè - Field names and structure stay the same every time\n",
    "3. **Explicit Refusals** üö´ - The model can refuse to output when appropriate\n",
    "4. **Simpler Prompting** ‚úçÔ∏è - No need to write detailed formatting instructions\n",
    "5. **Production Ready** üè≠ - Reliable enough for real applications\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° Key Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response formats are ideal for data extraction tasks** where you don't need the model to trigger functions or actions - you just want structured data back. Think of it as asking the model to fill out a form with specific fields!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Function calling is for triggering actions; response formats are for getting structured data\n",
    "- Response formats provide type-safe, consistent JSON outputs\n",
    "- Use response formats when you need to extract or generate structured information\n",
    "- This approach simplifies prompting and is production-ready"

    "### üéØ What is `json_schema`?\n",

    "text={\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### üåü The Magic Parameter: `strict: True`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the key to reliable structured outputs! When you set `strict: True`:\n",

    "- Field names are **always consistent**\n",
    "- Data types are **always correct**\n",
    "- Required fields are **always present**\n",
    "- No extra fields are added (when using `additionalProperties: false`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Key Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Predictable** - Same input structure every time\n",
    "2. **Type-safe** - Numbers are numbers, strings are strings\n",

    "#### üì¶ Array of Objects Pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"type\": \"array\",          // It's an array\n",
    "  \"items\": {                 // Each item in the array is:\n",
    "    \"type\": \"object\",        // An object\n",

    "    \"additionalProperties\": false\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üéØ Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Array of Simple Values** (strings, numbers):\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   \"tags\": {\n",
    "     \"type\": \"array\",\n",
    "     \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}  // Just specify the type\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Result: `[\"tech\", \"startup\", \"AI\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Array of Objects** (complex items):\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   \"employees\": {\n",
    "     \"type\": \"array\",\n",
    "     \"items\": {\n",
    "       \"type\": \"object\",         // Each item is an object\n",
    "       \"properties\": {...},       // Define its structure\n",
    "       \"required\": [...]\n",
    "     }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Result: `[{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"role\": \"Dev\"}, {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"role\": \"PM\"}]`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Required Fields Apply to Each Object**:\n",
    "   - Set `required` inside the `items` definition\n",
    "   - Every object in the array must have those fields\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use `additionalProperties: false`** at both levels:\n",
    "   - Top level (main object)\n",
    "   - Nested level (objects within arrays)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Real-World Benefit:\n",
    "\n",
    "With nested structures, you can model complex entities accurately:\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Each leader has consistent fields (name, title, years)\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Easy to loop through and access\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Type-safe - years is always an integer\n",
    "- ‚úÖ No parsing headaches!\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nested structures model real-world hierarchical data\n",
    "- Use `\"type\": \"array\"` with `\"items\": {\"type\": \"object\"}` for arrays of complex items\n",
    "- Define `properties` and `required` within the `items` definition\n",
    "- Each object in the array follows the same schema\n",
    "- Set `additionalProperties: false` at all levels for strictness\n",
    "- Nested data is easy to work with in code (loops, accessing fields)"

    "**‚úÖ Correct:**\n",

    "            \"schema\": your_schema,\n",
    "            \"strict\": True  # ‚úÖ Always include this!\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**‚ùå Wrong:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Missing strict: True\n",
    "text={\n",
    "    \"format\": {\n",
    "        \"type\": \"json_schema\",\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Without `strict: True`, the model may deviate from your schema. With it, you get **guaranteed consistency**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Use Enums for Fixed Choices üéØ\n",
    "\n",
    "When a field should only accept specific values, use enums!\n",
    "\n",
    "**‚úÖ Correct:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"status\": {\n",
    "    \"type\": \"string\",\n",

    "    \"description\": \"Status (should be pending, approved, or rejected)\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Result: Might get \"Pending\", \"approved\", \"denied\", \"Approved\" - inconsistent!\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use enums:**\n",
    "- Priority levels (low, medium, high)\n",
    "- Status values (active, inactive, pending)\n",
    "- Categories (fiction, non-fiction, biography)\n",
    "- Any field with a fixed set of options\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Add Descriptions to Fields üìù\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptions help the model understand what you want and improve extraction accuracy!\n",
    "\n",
    "**‚úÖ Correct:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"price\": {\n",
    "    \"type\": \"number\",\n",
    "    \"description\": \"Product price in USD as a decimal number (e.g., 29.99)\"\n",

    "    \"type\": \"number\"  # No description - less guidance for the model\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good description patterns:**\n",
    "- Specify format: `\"Date in YYYY-MM-DD format\"`\n",
    "- Give examples: `\"Duration in minutes (e.g., 90)\"`\n",
    "- Clarify ambiguity: `\"The person's age in years as an integer\"`\n",
    "- Explain enums: `\"Priority: low (minor), medium (normal), high (urgent)\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Set `additionalProperties` to `False` üö´\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevent the model from adding unexpected fields!\n",
    "\n",
    "**‚úÖ Correct:**\n",

    "    \"properties\": {\n",
    "        \"name\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n",

    "    \"required\": [...]\n",
    "    # Missing additionalProperties: False\n",

    "Result: Model might add extra fields like `\"nickname\"`, `\"email\"`, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "Choose the most specific type that fits your data!\n",

    "**‚úÖ Correct Choices:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Years, quantities, counts\n",

    "### ‚ùå Pitfall 1: Forgetting `strict: True`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the #1 mistake! Without `strict: True`, you lose all consistency guarantees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrong:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text={\n",
    "    \"format\": {\n",
    "        \"type\": \"json_schema\",\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** Field names might vary, types might be wrong, structure might differ between calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text={\n",
    "    \"format\": {\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**üí° Rule:** If you're using `json_schema`, ALWAYS set `strict: True`. No exceptions!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå Pitfall 2: Using Wrong Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the wrong type causes parsing errors and logic bugs.\n",

    "### ‚ùå Pitfall 3: Not Specifying Required Fields\n",
    "\n",

    "    # ‚ùå No required array - all fields optional!\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Result: Model might omit fields. Some responses have all fields, others are missing email or phone.\n",

    "```\n",
    "Result: Every response has all three fields. Phone can be `null` if not available.\n",
